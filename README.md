# Haos Resume Building Toolset

[This](https://entropyhaos.github.io/resume_building_toolset/) is a bit of boilerplate for creating a resume.

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template [ResumeCards](https://github.com/ellekasai/resumecards) by [Elle Kasai](https://github.com/ellekasai).

It creates two different resumes from a single set of "card" files.

It is setup to be developed and worked on using [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) and hosted on a GitHub [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.

The [setup script](https://github.com/EntropyHaos/resume_building_toolset/blob/master/z_scripts/setup_jekyll_for_gh_pages_on_c9.bash) will get a C9 configured for development.
